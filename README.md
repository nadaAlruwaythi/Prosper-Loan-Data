# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
by Nada 



# Project Details
This project is broken into two halves. In the first section, you will do exploratory data analysis on a dataset of your choice. To investigate the dataset's variables and comprehend the data's structure, anomalies, patterns, and relationships, you will utilize Python data science and data visualization modules. This section's analysis should be systematic, progressing from basic univariate relationships to multivariate relationships, although it does not have to be clean or faultless. There is no one solution that must emerge from a particular dataset. This section of the project allows you to ask questions about the data and create your own findings. Project Details comes to an end, and it may take several steps to get to what you're really searching for.


## Dataset:
 [Loan Data from Prosper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1554486256021000) with [Prosper Data Dictionary to Explain Dataset's Variables](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554486256024000)

This data set contains information on peer to peer loans facilitated by credit company Prosper. There are 113,937 loans with 81 variables. For the purpose of this investigation I've taken the following variables: Term, LoanStatus, BorrowerRate, ProsperRating (Alpha), ListingCategory (numeric), EmploymentStatus, DelinquenciesLast7Years, StatedMonthlyIncome, TotalProsperLoans, LoanOriginalAmount, LoanOriginationDate, Recommendations and Investors.
#### Step 1: Explore Your Data
 It's time to get to the good stuff. Investigate your data and record your results in a report. The report should begin by briefly introducing the dataset and then on to walk through the points of exploration that you did. Headers and text should be used to arrange your thoughts and discoveries. Visualizations in this section of the project do not need to be perfect: this is merely your personal experimentation at this time. However, you must still follow the concepts of utilizing proper plot types and encodings so that reliable conclusions can be formed, and you must include enough comments and labeling so that when you return to your work, you can easily comprehend your analytic methods.

#### step 2: Write down your story
 You've undoubtedly discovered a lot of items at the conclusion of your exploration. It is now time to compile your results and choose a tale to tell others. You should describe your primary discoveries and remark on the steps you followed in your data investigation in your readme document. You should also outline the important insights you want to express in your explanatory report, as well as any updates to visualizations or new visualizations that will be generated to connect your insights.

#### Step 3: Make a Slide Deck
Following the goals you outlined in the previous phase, develop a slide presentation using explanatory data visualizations to convey a story about the data you investigated. You can start with the code you used in your investigation, but make sure it is altered so that your plots are refined. In your modifications, be sure to keep features of design integrity in mind.

#### Step 4: Review and Submit the Project
